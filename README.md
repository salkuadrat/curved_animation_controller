# CurvedAnimationController

An easy way to use AnimationController with Curve.

## Getting Started

You should ensure that you add the controller as a dependency in your flutter project.

```yaml
dependencies:
  curved_animation_controller: ^0.0.1
```

You can also reference the git repo directly if you want:
```yaml
dependencies:
 fluro:
   git: git://github.com/salkuadrat/curved_animation_controller.git
```

You should then run `flutter packages upgrade` or update your packages in IntelliJ.

## Example Project

There is a pretty sweet example project in the `example` folder. Check it out. Otherwise, keep reading to get up and running.
